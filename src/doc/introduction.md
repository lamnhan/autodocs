## Introduction

Documentation is a crucial part of every great open-source projects. But making docs is such a Pain-In-The-Brain process.

Since [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) is an self documenting language, we can leverage its power to extract the source code information. This library is based on [Typedoc](https://typedoc.org), one of the best tool for generating Typescript documentation.

### What is it?

**docsuper** is a tool for generating documentation directly from the source code.

It provides 3 main services:

- [The `Parser`](#parser): turns the source into a [Declaration](#declaration).
- [The `Converter`](#converter): converts a [Declaration](#declaration) into content data.
- [The `Renderer`](#renderer): renders the content data to the final content.

Using [the CLI](#the-cli), you can easily generate a document by providing [the configuration](#options) in `package.json` or `docsuper.config.js` file.

An example configuration:

```json
{
  "files": {
    "README.md": {
      "head": true,
      "toc": true,
      "section1": ["Class1"],
      "section2": ["Interface2"],
      "license": true
    }
  }
}
```

Run `docsuper generate` will output:

- The `docs/` folder: the detail document, generated by [Typedoc](https://typedoc.org).
- And every document files based on the configuration.

> NOTE: **docsuper** uses [Typedoc](https://typedoc.org) to generate the detail documentation (can be ignored).
> [The CLI](#the-cli) is only used to generate simpler additional document files, such as `README.md`.

### What the benefits?

- Easy to config & usage
- Avoid reference mistakes and code duplications
- Improve source code quality with [TSdoc](https://github.com/microsoft/tsdoc)
- Save time and avoid brain damage

### The workflow

Adding **docsuper** to any project in less than 5 simple steps:

1. Coding as usual
2. (Optional) Documenting the source code with [TSdoc](https://github.com/microsoft/tsdoc)
3. (Optional) Putting custom sections and placeholders to files
4. Add [configuration](#configuration) to `package.json` or `docsuper.config.js`
5. Run `docsuper generate` to generate content
