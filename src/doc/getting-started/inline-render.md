You can include declaration render inline by using these formats:

- \[\[\[Main]]] (without `\`): equals `["Main"]`
- \[\[\[Options | FULL | {"title":"The Options"}]]] (without `\`): equals `["Options", "FULL", { title: 'The Options' }]`
- \{\@render Main} (without `\`)
- \{\@render Options | FULL | {"title":"The Options"}} (without `\`)
