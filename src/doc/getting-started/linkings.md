You can link to any source code element or a content heading without worry where they located by using the Typedoc linking syntax or the TSDoc syntax.

- `\[\[Main]]` (without `\`): link to `Main`
- `\[\[Main | the Main class]]` (without `\`): link to `Main` with custom title
- `\{\@link a-heading}` (without `\`): link to the heading with id `a-heading`
- `\{\@link a-heading | A heading}` (without `\`): link to the heading with id `a-heading`
